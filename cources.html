                (http://www.aau.in/anand-agricultural-university-anand), and Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS),
                ISRO, Dehradun (https:// www.iirs.gov.in/) are jointly offering a two-year “M.Sc. program in Agriculture
                Analytics.” DA-IICT, AAU and IIRS are the premier universities/ Institutes in ICT, Agriculture, and
                Space Technology domain, respectively. This is a multidisciplinary program of agriculture and data
                analytics. The program is aimed at nurturing students, with insights and the know-how to take the sector
                into the future. The course will introduce students to concepts of data analytics, viz. descriptive,
                predictive and prescriptive, in agriculture and will empower the students to eliminate speculative
                farming and usher in the age of predictive agriculture.</p>
